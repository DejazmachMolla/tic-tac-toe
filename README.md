# TIC-TAC-TOE Game
> TIC-TAC-TOE is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
> This project creates a software based replacement for the paper-and-pencil game.

## Built With
- Ruby
- Rubocop

## Requirements
- The code should demonstrate Object Oriented Design
- The workflow used should be Git flow and 4 feature branches need to be created
- The game should validate user input and handle winning, draw(tie) behaviors

## Getting Started
- Clone the project in to your computer using `git clone https://github.com/DejazmachMolla/tic-tac-toe.git`
